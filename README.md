#RZCOVID19 <br />
These are the data of different states for COVID-19 which shows the confirmed cases, deceased , recovered and tested patientes taken from [covid19india.org](https://www.covid19india.org/). <br />
A small analysis has been done to convert this data (upto 18-Nov-2020) to convert into weekely basis and check its consistency with **Renormalization group approach** (https://doi.org/10.3389/fphy.2020.00144) and see it's valiaity with India data.<br />
The directory states_plot shows the same analysis done with and without log scale.<br />
The generic.py code is for the reference code that can be implented for any partiuclar state to show if Renormalization group approach is valid for covid data or not. <br />
